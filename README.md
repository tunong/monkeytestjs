# MonkeyTestJS demo

This project is a demo of using MonkeyTestJS to run javascript unit tests. In this demo, we have a site with HTML5 and custom form validation. The validation would be unit tested automatically using MonkeyTestJS.

The index.html file is created based on [html5boilerplate.com](http://html5boilerplate.com/).


## Quick start

1. Clone the source code to your local web server www folder.
   Go to [http://localhost/monkeytestjs/](http://localhost/monkeytestjs/) to view the form.
2. Go to [http://localhost/monkeytestjs/tests/](http://localhost/monkeytestjs/tests/) to see the unit test result.
